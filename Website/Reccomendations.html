          </figure>
          <p>It claims to be the world's hardest game and it does not dissapoint, it very well could be the worlds hardest game. The game begins reasonably simple, as the player you have to move your red square from the first green safe zone to the last green safe zone. However yo must do so by avoiding thee moving obstacles in your path. The game becomes progressivley harder as the levels are completed to the point where it seems impossible to complete. The game requires lots of concentration and logical thinking so as to predict the movements of obstacles during the game so that they can be avoided. The game keeps a track of the deaths that you have had during your play of the game, and this is  a great way to be able to compare with friends whos the better player, along with who gets to the highest level of course. The game is available to play on the web in various locations and a link to one is provided below:

          </figure>
          <p>Bee brilliant is a game that is a great for kids, it is all about exploring the world of crazy bees and cheeky spiders. The aim is to connect the colourful lines of bees, in order to release the bees that are frozen. The music is extremely catchy and can be funny at times especially after each time you complete a level. There are 155 levels to complete so the game becomes very addictive and progressively more challenging, the more you play the more addicted you become. I feel it has beneifts to anyone that plays it as it requires the use of ones logical reasoning in order to connect as many bees as possible in a single instance so that you can generate a high enough score to unlock the following level. The game is available to play from both the android and IOS appstores and links are provided below:

             <!-- Screen captures from a playthrough of Super Sharp-->
          </figure>
          <p>Super sharp is one of my favourite games! It is a game where the player has to judge where to cut a series of blocks in order to hit the different colour co-ordinated blocks. As you go through the levels the difficulty increases, increasing the level of logic that you have to apply in order to solve a level. It is exceptionally good for stimulating ones logic and reasoning abilities whilst having to drop, bounce and swing objects in a fun and amusing way. It is a simple yet effective game that is appropriate for all ages. The game is available from the ios appstore at:

            <!-- Screen captures from a playthrough of Two Dots-->
          </figure>
          <p>Two dots is a game where as the player ypou have to connect the coloured dots together so that other dots will fall into a desirable position. The aim is to try and make as mny 2x2 squares as possible as these will will destroy every dot of that corresponing colour which has maximum effect. The game offers hundreds of levels, each progressively getting more difficult and adding new features every now and again in order to keep the game interesting. This game is great for passing time and can be played countless times since its re-playabity factor will keep you wanting more. This is certainly a game that mut be reccomened to anyone unless that someone is worried they may start spending too much time puzzling!
