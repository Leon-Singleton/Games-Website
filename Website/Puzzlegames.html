          <p>A sliding blocks puzzle consists of an image that is sperated into several pieces that are placed within a grid as block pieces. Within the grid one block space, where you would expect a part of the image to go is left blank. This is so that when the user clicks one of the blocks surrounidng this empty position then that block will move into that position and its original space will become blank. The aim of the puzzle is to re-construct the original image.</p>

          <p>Snakes and ladders is a tradtional two or more player board game where the players take it in turns to roll a dice and then move their corresponidng piece by that many places. The winner is the first player to reach the end of the game board. However, this is harder than it seems because if a player lands on the head of a snake they have to move thir piece to the end of the snake. In contrast if a player's piece lands at the bottom of a ladder then they have to move their piece to the top of the ladder. </p>
